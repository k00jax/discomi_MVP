=== CORRECTED DEVELOPER SETTINGS URL ===

**The Issue:**
Your previous URL was missing the `uid` parameter!
You used: ?token=u_a228ec0af0...
But the code needs BOTH token AND uid.

**Corrected URL for Developer Settings:**
https://discomi-mvp-ochre.vercel.app/api/webhook?token=u_a228ec0af0ae258b3f15a1a4e89c48952a6f4abb30d7c613&uid=W7xTEw3Yjde3XSbUyS0ZSNlcb852

**Why both parameters are needed:**
1. `uid=W7xTEw3Yjde3XSbUyS0ZSNlcb852` - Tells the webhook which user's Discord webhook to look up
2. `token=u_a228ec0af0...` - Authenticates that you're allowed to post as this user

**The code flow:**
Step 1: Extract uid from query string (line 284-231)
Step 2: Look up user config by uid in database (line 320-325)
Step 3: If not Omi-signed, verify token matches (line 328-332)

You were failing at Step 1 because no uid was provided!

**Alternative: Use app token instead (simpler):**
https://discomi-mvp-ochre.vercel.app/api/webhook?app=app_9d7c3b2f4e8a1c6d0f2a5b9e3c7d1a4f8b2e6c0d3a7f1b5e9c4d2a8f0b6e3c1&uid=W7xTEw3Yjde3XSbUyS0ZSNlcb852

This uses the app token (which never changes) plus your uid.

**For app store submission:**
https://discomi-mvp-ochre.vercel.app/api/webhook?app=app_9d7c3b2f4e8a1c6d0f2a5b9e3c7d1a4f8b2e6c0d3a7f1b5e9c4d2a8f0b6e3c1

Omi automatically appends &uid=... for each user who installs the app.
